I am writing to formally appeal the "${problem.en}" issue affecting my Facebook Page/Profile "${pageName}" (Category: ${pageCat || "General"}, Followers: ${followers || "N/A"}).

Issue Description:
${probDesc || `I have been experiencing "${problem.en}" and would like to request a review.`}

About My Page/Profile:
My page "${pageName}" creates original, authentic content for our community of followers. We are fully committed to following all of Facebook's Community Standards and Partner Monetization Policies.

I believe this situation warrants a careful manual review. We have worked hard to build a legitimate, policy-compliant presence on the platform and take all guidelines seriously.

Steps I Have Already Taken:
- Reviewed all content against Facebook's Community Standards
- Removed any borderline content proactively
- Implemented stricter internal content review processes going forward

I respectfully request that your team review this decision and restore full functionality to my page/account. I welcome any guidance on specific steps I should take to resolve this matter.

Thank you sincerely for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
${pageName} Admin
Date: ${date}`;
